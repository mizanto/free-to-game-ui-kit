    "description": "Dauntless is a free-to-play, co-op action RPG developed by independent studio Phoenix Labs — a studio made of of veteran developers from Bioware, Riot, Capcom, and Blizzard. Set in a science-fantasy world, Dauntless places players in the role of elite warriors called Slayers. These Slayers protect humanity from Behemoths that are consuming the land following a cataclysmic event that turned the landscape into ever-changing, floating islands.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay may remind players of Monster Hunter, or perhaps a cheerier version of Shadow of the Colossus, where the goal is to defeat massive creates in an vast landscape.\r\n\r\nDauntless is playable solo, although it is designed with co-op play in mind. It boasts a variety of unique encounters and rewards players with items that will allow them to upgrade weapons and armor — enabling them to become even stronger warriors.",
